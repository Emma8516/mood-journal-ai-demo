Mood Journal AI is a journaling web app that helps users record their thoughts and emotions.
It uses AI to analyze moods and provide personalized advice, while each mood is visualized as a colorful orb collected in a glass jar — symbolizing emotional reflection and growth.
Built with Next.js, Firebase, and OpenAI, it combines journaling, mood analytics, and modern UI design into one mindful experience.
